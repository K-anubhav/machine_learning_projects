# Objective:
The objective of this project is to compute performance metrics without using sklearn. The project involves computing performance metrics like confusion matrix, F1 score, AUC score, and accuracy score for different datasets. The project also involves computing the best threshold of probability which gives the lowest values of the metric A.

# Data:
The project uses four different datasets: 5_a.csv, 5_b.csv, 5_c.csv, and 5_d.csv. The datasets have different numbers of positive and negative points, and they contain real-valued features.

# Methodology:
The project involves computing different performance metrics for each dataset. The project uses pandas and numpy libraries to read the data from the datasets. The project also involves deriving the class labels from given scores and computing the best threshold of probability for a given dataset. 

# High-level statistics of the dataset:
The datasets used in the project have different numbers of positive and negative points. The project involves computing different performance metrics for each dataset, including confusion matrix, F1 score, AUC score, accuracy score, mean square error, MAPE, and R^2 error.

# Observations:
The project showcases how to compute performance metrics without using sklearn. The project also shows how to compute the best threshold of probability for a given dataset. The project demonstrates how to use pandas and numpy libraries to read data from different datasets and derive class labels. Overall, the project is a useful resource for anyone interested in computing performance metrics in Python without using sklearn.
